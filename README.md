# tfl-travel

A Javascript web application to calculate the cheapest ticket one can buy for TFL travel in London

FUTURE UPDATES:

- Map where people can select the region in which they live, and the workplace they need to commute to regularly (use this as the way of input instead of a simple HTLM form)
- Research the different zones as well as which other factors will affect the price (e.g. distance between home and workplace, London travel zones, method of transport etc.)
